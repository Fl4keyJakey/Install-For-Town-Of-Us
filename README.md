# Install-For-Town-Of-Us

This is a simple script written in batch, it currently is only for windows, however i might make a version for linux.

## Current Featues

* Installs DepotDownloader to download specific version of among us needed
* Installs Among Us and Town Of Us and adds the files to the among us folder

## Planned Featues

- [ ] Automatic manifest and mod fetch so script won't need to be updated everytime
- [ ] Automatically check for updates to the script and prompts for a install + does the install

## Other stuff

alr so i aint a good programmer, actually i wouldn't even call myself one, i just made this because i have a friend group where it takes awhile for us to set it up because i gotta help everyone, and it ends up with people being frustrated.

Anyway, feedback is greatly appreciated, mostly because i'm 100% sure this can be optimized somehow, but i wanted to create it in batch because so my friends won't have to install any programs like python or stuff to run it (i know i can package it all but still)
